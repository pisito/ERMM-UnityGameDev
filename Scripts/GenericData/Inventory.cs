        /**
         * Inventory Limits: Implement a maximum size or weight limit for the inventory, requiring players to manage their items more carefully.
        Item Stacks:
            Allow certain items to stack within a single inventory slot, which is common for consumables like potions.
        Sorting and Filtering: 
            Add methods to sort items by type, name, or other properties, and to filter items to easily find what the player is looking for.
        Equipment Slots: 
            You might have specific slots for equipped items (weapons, armor, etc.), separate from the general inventory.
